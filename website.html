                    <p id="first-para">Impressionism developed in France in the nineteenth century and is based on the practice of painting out of doors and spontaneously ‘on the spot’ rather than in a studio from sketches. Main impressionist subjects were landscapes and scenes of everyday life.</p>

                        nstead of painting in a studio, the impressionists found that they could capture the momentary and transient effects of sunlight by working quickly, in front of their subjects, in the open air (en plein air) rather than in a studio. This resulted in a greater awareness of light and colour and the shifting pattern of the natural scene. Brushwork became rapid and broken into separate dabs in order to render the fleeting quality of light. 
                    </p>

                    <h3>History of Impressionism</h3>

                    <p class="paragraph">In 1874, a group of artists called the Anonymous Society of Painters, Sculptors, Printmakers, etc. organized an exhibition in Paris that launched the movement called Impressionism. Its founding members included Claude Monet, Edgar Degas, and Camille Pissarro, among others. The group was unified only by its independence from the official annual Salon, for which a jury of artists from the Académie des Beaux-Arts selected artworks and awarded medals. </p>

                    <img class="main-image" src="https://az333960.vo.msecnd.net/images-6/the-dance-class-edgar-degas-1874-dd37ff7e.jpg" width="400" alt="The Dance Class by Edgar Degas, 1874">

                    <p class="citation">The Dance Class by Edgar Degas, 1874</p>

                    <p class="paragraph">The independent artists, despite their diverse approaches to painting, appeared to contemporaries as a group. While conservative critics panned their work for its unfinished, sketchlike appearance, more progressive writers praised it for its depiction of modern life. Their work is recognized today for its modernity, embodied in its rejection of established styles, its incorporation of new technology and ideas, and its depiction of modern life.</p>

                    <h3>Where did the movement gets its name?</h3>

                    <p class="paragraph">Claude Monet’s Impression, Sunrise (Musée Marmottan Monet, Paris) exhibited in 1874, gave the Impressionist movement its name when the critic Louis Leroy accused it of being a sketch or “impression,” not a finished painting. </p>

                    <img class="main-image" src="https://www.claude-monet.com/assets/img/paintings/impression-sunrise.jpg" width="400" alt="Impression Sunrise by Claude Monet, 1872">

                    <p class="citation">Impression Sunrise by Claude Monet, 1872</p>

                    <blockquote>"Impression—I was certain of it. I was just telling myself that, since I was impressed, there had to be some impression in it … and what freedom, what ease of workmanship! Wallpaper in an embryonic state is more finished than that seascape."</blockquote>
                    <p class="quote-citation">Louis Leroy, “Exhibition des Impressionnistes,” Le Charivari (25 April 1874), as translated in John Rewald, The History of Impressionism (1946)</p>

                    <!-- Source: https://smarthistory.org/claude-monets-impression-sunrise/ -->
                    
                    <p class="paragraph">It demonstrates the techniques many of the independent artists adopted: short, broken brushstrokes that barely convey forms, pure unblended colors, and an emphasis on the effects of light. Rather than neutral white, grays, and blacks, Impressionists often rendered shadows and highlights in color. The artists’ loose brushwork gives an effect of spontaneity and effortlessness that masks their often carefully constructed compositions. This seemingly casual style became widely accepted, even in the official Salon, as the new language with which to depict modern life.</p>

                    <h3>Characteristics and Style of Impressionism</h3>

                    <p>There was no one unifying Impressionist style, but the artists associated with Impressionism did share similar modern approaches to painting.</p>
                        
                    <p>Rather than be confined to a studio, many Impressionists preferred to paint en plein air in the countryside outside of Paris; this approach required the artists to work quickly but allowed them to capture the fleeting impressions of light. The artists used short, visible dabs of paint to capture the overall impression of their subject, choosing not to pay particular attention to the fine details.</p>

                    <img class="main-image" src="https://az333959.vo.msecnd.net/images-6/young-woman-with-a-straw-hat-berthe-morisot-1884-dbc20fee.jpg" width="400" alt="Young Woman with a Straw Hat by Berthe Morisot, 1884">

                    <p class="citation">Young Woman with a Straw Hat by Berthe Morisot, 1884</p>

                    <p>Instead of using black and gray paint to depict shadows, the painters paired complementary colors. The paints themselves were also brighter than those used in previous eras, due to the invention of synthetic pigments. The artists applied new layers of paint over layers that were still wet, which softened the forms and supplied a unique intermingling of colors. The layers were rarely transparent – instead, the application added opaque dimensions of color.</p>

                    <h3>Impressionist Artists</h3>

                    <p>Regardless of technique, artists were considered Impressionists if they exhibited at any point in the group Impressionist shows.</p>

                    <p>While Monet is the artist most closely associated with Impressionism, and Manet’s greatest work are most associated with Realism than Impressionism, Manet is nonetheless a pivotal figure in the Impressionist movement. The artist’s ongoing battle with the Salon over the institution's antiquated guidelines and biased jury made him a hero of the avant-garde and paved the way for Impressionists to establish their own exhibition.</p>

                    <img class="main-image" src="https://az334033.vo.msecnd.net/images-9/masked-ball-at-the-opera-edouard-manet-1873-62981bf6.jpg" width="400" alt="Masked Ball at the Opera by Edouard Manet, 1873">

                    <p class="citation">Masked Ball at the Opera by Edouard Manet, 1873</p>

                    <p>The most prominent exhibiting Impressionists besides Monet and Manet are Renoir, Degas, Cézanne, Pissarro, Morisot, Mary Cassatt, Sisley, Gustave Caillebotte, Armand Guillaumin and Bazille.</p>

                    <h3>Japanese Influence</h3>

                    <p>While the content of Impressionist paintings was not all that radical, the composition was. The boundary between figures and background were blurred, making the figures a part of an overall view rather than the main subject, and the figures appeared to be captured in a single moment – as a snapshot – rather than posed. This new approach coincided with the advent of photography and drew inspiration from Japanese style ukiyo-e art prints.</p>

                    <img class="main-image" src="https://s.studiobinder.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/What-is-Ukiyo-e-Ukiyo-e-Artists-%E2%80%A2-The-Great-Wave-off-Kanagawa-by-Hokusai-1831.png" width="400" alt="The Great Wave off Kanagawa by Hokusai, 1831">

                    <p class="citation">The Great Wave off Kanagawa by Hokusai, 1831</p>

                    <p>The ukiyo-e style used foreshortening (angling an object toward a viewer to change the allusion of three-dimensional perspective on a two-dimensional surface) asymmetry to invoke movement and action within a scene. For the Impressionist artists, this technique from the East was a crucial tool in their exploration of a new, modern painting style.</p>

                    <h3>After Impressionism: "Post Impressionism"</h3>

                    <p>While the Impressionists paved the way by leaning more into emotion than pictorial recreation, they still focused on the primary subject of art being the outside world. Around five to ten years after Impressionism became more relevant, artists had time to react. They took this philosophy of emotion from the Impressionists, but turned it inward toward the artist. </p>

                    <img class="main-image" src="https://s.studiobinder.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/What-is-Post-Impressionism-Vincent-van-Gogh-Cafe-Terrace-at-Night-1888.png" width="400" alt="The Great Wave off Kanagawa by Hokusai, 1831">

                    <p class="citation">Café Terrace at Night by Vincent van Gogh, 1888</p>

                    <p>Traditionally, art had always been a way for artists to present the outside world to others through the work they created. But now, artists wondered if art could be a way to present themselves through their depictions of the external world. With this idea and approach to art, Post-Impressionism emerged.</p>
